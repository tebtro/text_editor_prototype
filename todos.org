- [ ] render only visible area
- [ ] cursor save offset, if you only move up or down, and not left right, you should keep the offset also between lines with different length

- [ ] input system, like in 4coder a method to bind with the key and its modifiers to a function (in 4coder custom command sig).
  The function to call gets then added to a hashtable with a string as key like "C-A" or something, where C stands for CTRL. And the value is the function name to call.
  In the event loop we then generate the key and look it up in the hashtable.
  
  Something like that, im not that sure about it yet.
