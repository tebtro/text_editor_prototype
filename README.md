# text_editor_prototype

First SDL2 project.
SDL because it seemed easy for displaying text.

Not really a text editor, just a test for displaying glyphs on the screen.

But it has some small features:
- add/remove text obviously
- cursor + scrolling
- Multiple files
- Multiple windows/views
- split views vertically/horizontally
- keybinding system
